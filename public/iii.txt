Review of Literature and Studies
Renovating the Multi-Purpose Hall (MPH) Court at New Era University College is essential for improving its functionality and creating a more comfortable space for students, teachers, and athletes. Addressing issues like poor lighting and ventilation will enhance the overall experience and safety of those using the facility while also increasing energy efficiency.

The Role of Proper Lighting
Good lighting plays a crucial role in sports facilities, affecting both performance and safety. Research shows that LED lighting provides bright, even illumination, reducing shadows and dark areas that can hinder visibility or increase the risk of injuries. LEDs are also a smart investment because they use less energy and last longer compared to traditional lighting options. Schools and sports centers that have switched to LED lights have reported lower electricity costs and improved visibility on their courts (LED Lighting Supply, 2024).

The Role of Air Quality
The quality of indoor air in sports facilities plays a vital role in maintaining the health and performance of athletes, coaches, and spectators. Koivisto (2021) states that increased physical activity leads to higher respiratory rates, which, in turn, results in greater inhalation of air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other harmful contaminants. Poor air quality in enclosed sports venues can contribute to respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and long-term lung damage.

Thermal Comfort in Indoor Sports Facilities
In indoor sports facilities, varying occupancy levels and increased heat and moisture emissions from athletes create additional strain on ventilation systems. This thesis explores human thermal response and the suitability of demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) in these environments as part of the LIIKU project, which examines indoor air quality and its potential effects on occupant health and well-being.

The Need for Better Ventilation
Proper ventilation is equally important, especially in enclosed spaces like gymnasiums and multi-purpose halls. Studies indicate that poor airflow can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels, which may cause fatigue and reduce concentration. In high-traffic areas, inadequate ventilation can also contribute to the spread of airborne illnesses. Ensuring a continuous flow of fresh air can significantly improve air quality, creating a healthier and more comfortable environment for everyone (PMC, 2022).

Examples of Successful Facility Upgrades
Several institutions have successfully upgraded their facilities by improving lighting and ventilation:
TBCS Gymnasium Lighting Project – This gym replaced outdated lighting fixtures with energy-efficient LED lights, resulting in improved brightness, reduced energy consumption, and lower maintenance costs. The upgrade significantly enhanced the playing conditions while extending the lifespan of the lighting system (LED Lighting Supply, 2024 ).
Blach School Facility Improvement – This school focused on enhancing indoor spaces by incorporating more natural light and optimizing airflow. The renovations led to lower energy costs and a healthier indoor environment, benefiting both students and staff (New Buildings Institute, n.d.).
