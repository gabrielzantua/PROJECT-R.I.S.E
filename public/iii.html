            <h3 id="literature" class="iii-section">Review of Literature and Studies</h3>
            <p class="iii-paragraph">Renovating the Multi-Purpose Hall (MPH) Court at New Era University College is essential for improving its functionality and creating a more comfortable space for students, teachers, and athletes. Addressing issues like poor lighting and ventilation will enhance the overall experience and safety of those using the facility while also increasing energy efficiency.</p>

            <h4 class="iii-subsection">The Role of Proper Lighting</h4>
            <p class="iii-paragraph">Good lighting plays a crucial role in sports facilities, affecting both performance and safety. Research shows that LED lighting provides bright, even illumination, reducing shadows and dark areas that can hinder visibility or increase the risk of injuries. LEDs are also a smart investment because they use less energy and last longer compared to traditional lighting options. Schools and sports centers that have switched to LED lights have reported lower electricity costs and improved visibility on their courts (LED Lighting Supply, 2024).</p>

            <h4 class="iii-subsection">The Role of Air Quality</h4>
            <p class="iii-paragraph">The quality of indoor air in sports facilities plays a vital role in maintaining the health and performance of athletes, coaches, and spectators. Koivisto (2021) states that increased physical activity leads to higher respiratory rates, which, in turn, results in greater inhalation of air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other harmful contaminants. Poor air quality in enclosed sports venues can contribute to respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and long-term lung damage.</p>

            <h4 class="iii-subsection">Thermal Comfort in Indoor Sports Facilities</h4>
            <p class="iii-paragraph">In indoor sports facilities, varying occupancy levels and increased heat and moisture emissions from athletes create additional strain on ventilation systems.
